> A very, very simple personal website.

## Build
**No build**. Just an HTML file with some Vue and pure CSS assets. 
The CSS uses natively supported variables, defined in the [main stylesheet](assets/style.css). 
These are also used in [theme files](assets/theme-light.css), as they're loaded in the DOM afterwards.
